4.1 Research activity topics
Development of deep learning algorithms for blood glucose forecasting in type 1 diabetes (2024-Today)
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a chronic metabolic condition characterized by a deficiency in insulin production—a key hormone responsible for regulating blood glucose (BG) levels. As a result, individuals with T1D must continuously manage their BG to stay within the safe physiological range (70–180 mg/dL), often taking corrective actions when their levels deviate from this range. Forecasting algorithms can support this effort by enabling patients to act proactively, helping to prevent or mitigate impending glycemic events.
The field of BG forecasting in T1D has been extensively studied, with numerous algorithms proposed and several comprehensive reviews published. However, recent advancements in computational power and the increasing availability of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data have accelerated the adoption of deep learning approaches in this domain. Existing reviews, which generally cover developments up to 2020 and take a broader perspective, do not fully capture these emerging trends. To address this gap, we propose an updated review that focuses specifically on deep learning-based BG forecasting [SJ2].
In our review, we identify a key challenge in the field: the lack of a standardized evaluation framework, which hampers fair cross-study comparisons. Additionally, the most commonly used dataset—OhioT1DM—includes data from only 12 subjects, raising concerns about the generalizability of reported findings. This highlights the need for larger, more diverse, and comprehensive datasets to support the development and robust evaluation of BG forecasting models. To address this, we benchmarked the T1DEXI, which includes four weeks of data from 497 individuals with T1D. Using this dataset, we found that deep learning models outperform traditional autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) models [A3], and that incorporating insulin, meal, and exercise information leads to improved performance over CGM-only approaches [C1].
In the review we also observed a limited adoption of eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques, which are essential for the safe and effective deployment of deep learning models in clinical practice. To address this gap, our upcoming publication focuses on evaluating the physiological fidelity of deep learning approaches, identifying their limitations, and proposing a solution through a physiologically-informed neural network.


4.2 Major research achievements
Development of a new decision support system for type 1 diabetes management based on CGM sensors data
In type 1 diabetes, patients must take a bolus of exogenous insulin to lower glucose concentration levels after meal intakes. For this purpose, current standard of care indicates the use of empirical guidelines for the calculation of the right amount of insulin to inject. However, has demonstrated in [J5] and [J14], they are suboptimal and potential harmful for the patients. For this reason, we started developing new algorithms, based on machine learning techniques, for the personalization and optimization of the insulin bolus calculation in type 1 diabetes therapy using CGM data (main goal of my PhD research project). Two algorithms have been developed: a neural network-based bolus calculator targeting the optimal insulin dose, and a simple heuristic based on a gradient boosted tree classifier. The two approaches demonstrated to outperform the standard rules for insulin bolus calculation and, by product, to improve safety for the user. This work was published in [J3][J6][C1][A4][A5][A7]. 
Design of new model-based techniques for meal insulin bolus calculation has also been investigated. Three models have been developed. Each of the methodologies have been evaluated in silico allowing to achieve far better glycaemic performance when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Presentation of the results is reported in [J11][A7][A9][A10] [A12][A17][AN1]. Furthermore, nonlinear techniques have been explored for the scope. These techniques have demonstrated to improve the performance of [J11]. This part of the work is documented in [J18][C4] [C8].
In parallel with the development of new effective algorithms for insulin bolus calculation, CGM-based algorithms for generating predictive alerts and suggesting optimal preventive actions have been explored. A new algorithm for generating hypoglycemic alerts has been developed and tested in silico using the T1D patient decision simulator, and it demonstrated to outperform the standard rule for hypoglycemia treatment recommended by the American Diabetes Association. This work was published in [J7] [C3] [A6] [A8] [A11] and a patent was filed [P1] and acquired by an international company. This work was part of the 2018-2021 agreement for consulting services between DEI-UNIPD and Dexcom Inc. (see Section 8.1). Lately, we focused on the development of new algorithms for the suggestion of correction insulin bolus administrations based on CGM-generated predictive alerts to manage hyperglycemia. Preliminary results show an evident improvement with respect to standard treatment. This part of the work was documented in [C9][CNI1][A24][AN4][SJ6].  
Finally, the algorithms for meal insulin bolus calculation reported in [J11] and CGM-based predictive alerts and treatment published in [J7] and [C9] were integrated in the mobile platform described in [J13] the aim being building a unique mobile decision support system (DSS) for patients affected by type 1 diabetes. A preliminary work, describing the structure of the DSS is [C10]. Current undergoing work aims to refining and extensively validating the DSS in challenging in silico scenarios and on retrospective real data leveraging the tool described in [J20]. A paper reporting these results will be prepared and submitted soon.
