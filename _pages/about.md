My research focuses on enhancing type 1 diabetes care through the development of a deep learning-powered clinical decision support system for proactive therapeutic interventions, utilizing explainable blood glucose forecasting. I am a Ph.D. Student in Information Engineering (Bioengineering curriculum) at the University of Padova, Italy.

My work involves developing deep learning algorithms for blood glucose forecasting, with a focus on creating a standardized evaluation framework and addressing the need for larger, more diverse datasets. I am also exploring the use of eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure the safe and effective deployment of these models in clinical practice. Additionally, I have worked on developing new algorithms for the personalization and optimization of insulin bolus calculation in type 1 diabetes therapy using CGM data.
